# Information

Welcome to our first ever hybrid Capricon! We’re excited to rock the outer realms both in-person in the hotel and online around the world! Here’s what you need to know to navigate our hybrid space.

If you are only attending Capricon virtually, filter using the "Virtual" tag to see what program items will be accessible to you.

Any program item happening in a room name starting with Zoom Room or with (virtual) in the title  is an online program item which you will (eventually) access by visiting [virtual.capricon.org](https://virtual.capricon.org/). Items taking place in Zoom Room 1 will also be streamed into the Colorado room at the hotel, so you can go there to watch that item with other fans. You will be able to ask questions of the panelists, either by typing them into the corresponding Discord channel yourself, or asking the volunteer in the room to do it for you.

Program items taking place in the Erie room on Friday and Saturday will be broadcast to the virtual portal so that our virtual members can be part of what’s happening at the hotel too, and ask questions of in-person panelists.

Virtual items will NOT be recorded. Just like at an in-person convention, you’ll have to choose what to participate in each hour.

All times listed are in CST unless otherwise noted.
